        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An easy Italian tomato sauce made from scratch with just 4 ingredients in only 10 minutes! This tomato sauce is perfect for pasta, pizza or simply for dunking some char-grilled ciabatta into. It’s  rich in flavour and couldn’t be easier!</p>

        <h2>Ingredient list</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>15 oz good quality canned chopped tomatoes, <em>(400g)</em></li>
            <li>1 handful fresh basil</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop or crush the garlic and add it to a skillet or frying pan with 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil. Saute the garlic for 1 minute or until fragrant (don’t let it brown).</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes then rinse out the can with 1-2 tablespoons of water and add that to the sauce. If your tomatoes are quite chunky or you prefer a smoother consistency you can use a potato masher to crush them at this point (optional).</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt and simmer on a medium heat for 8-10 minutes until reduced slightly. Turn off the heat and add a handful of freshly chopped basil (optional).</li>
            <li>If serving with pasta, use a small amount of pasta water to emulsify the sauce, add the pasta and toss until thoroughly coated (sauce makes enough for 400g or 14oz of pasta to serve 4).</li>
        </ol>
