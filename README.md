# odin-recipes

This project is directly linked to The Odin Project! It is a website built by a new learner of both HTML and CSS!

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few
recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but
it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML
chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

The skills that are represented in this project are HTML working with Git/GitHub and CSS.
